> This paper was written as the final essay for my Spring 2020 Operating Systems class. [You can read the original essay here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XtpPa6jqbExDGZKi9LWZaS481Ggla6n0/view). I've reformatted and edited most of it to make it more readable and legible.

The more one looks at old, nonexistent operating systems, the more one understands exactly _why_ the popular operating systems we enjoy today are still in general use. Older operating systems share a large amount of similarities with current operating systems; the theory and patterns older operating systems incorporated are still in use in most modern-day operating systems.

Adding some words here to test this out.
