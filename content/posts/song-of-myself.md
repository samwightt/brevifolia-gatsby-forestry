This is just some test content to see how well this will work. So far, it seems to be working pretty decently.

The editor in Forestry is absurdly good. _Incredibly_ good. It generates markdown very well, has keyboard shortcuts for **formatting**, and just in general feels amazing. I'm very surprised that they were able to implement something _this good_.

So for instance, here's an image. It works _really well_. Also you get commits out of these, which is amazing.

The only downside really is that _Forestry generates a lot of commits_**. Like a lot**. It's pretty bad about doing stuff efficiently.

Other than that, I don't really see any advantage this has over something like Svbtle (which I **really** like). I just hate that it's git-backed and that I can't do anything decent in it.
